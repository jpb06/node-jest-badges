## :zap: Badges for everyone!

Let's just imagine you want to display some information about your testing coverage and you're using jest as a testing framework. Look no further!

## :zap: Badges?

This package generates the following badges for you, based on the coverage report generated by jest, using instanbul. The first badge is the average of the four next coverage percentages.

- ![Total coverage](./badges/coverage-global%20coverage.svg)
- ![Branches](./badges/coverage-branches.svg)
- ![Functions](./badges/coverage-functions.svg)
- ![Lines](./badges/coverage-lines.svg)
- ![Statements](./badges/coverage-statements.svg)

## :zap: Github action

If you want to integrate this to your CI/CD, you have a [github action available for this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jest-badges-generation-action).

## :zap: Requirements

### :diamonds: Jest

Well, let's just start by stating the obvious here. Yes, you will need [jest testing library](https://jestjs.io/) to use this package.

## :zap: Setup

### :diamonds: Install

```shell
yarn add -D node-jest-badges
```

or

```shell
npm i -D node-jest-badges
```

### :diamonds: Jest configuration

You will need to add json-summary to coverage reporters in jest config:

```javascript
module.exports = {
   coverageReporters: ["json-summary"];
};
```

## :zap: Usage

You have two ways to generate coverage badges: cli and node. Both will create a 'badges' folder at project root where .svg files will be written.

### :diamonds: Cli

You can add a script to your package.json like so:

```shell
  "scripts": {
    "badges": "generateBadges"
  },
```

### :diamonds: Node

Another way is to directly use the package:

```javascript
import { generateBadges } from 'node-jest-badges';

(async () => {
  await generateBadges();
})();
```

## Thanks

Big thanks to [Shield](https://github.com/badges/shields) for this awesome tool!
