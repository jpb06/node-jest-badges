## âš¡ Badges for everyone

Let's just imagine you want to display some information about your testing coverage and you're using jest as a testing framework. Look no further!

## âš¡ Badges?

This package generates the following badges for you, based on the coverage report generated by jest, using instanbul.

| Badge                                                   | Description                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ![Branches](./badges/coverage-branches.svg)             | Percentage of DD-paths followed during tests   |
| ![Functions](./badges/coverage-functions.svg)           | Percentage of functions executed within tests  |
| ![Lines](./badges/coverage-lines.svg)                   | Percentage of lines covered by tests           |
| ![Statements](./badges/coverage-statements.svg)         | Percentage of statements executed within tests |
| ![Jest coverage](./badges/coverage-jest%20coverage.svg) | Average of the above coverage percentages      |

## âš¡ Github action

If you want to integrate this to your CI/CD, you have a [github action available for this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jest-badges-generation-action).

## âš¡ Requirements

### ðŸ”¶ Jest

Well, let's just start by stating the obvious here. Yes, you will need [jest testing library](https://jestjs.io/) to use this package.

## âš¡ Setup

### ðŸ”¶ Install

```shell
yarn add -D node-jest-badges
```

or

```shell
npm i -D node-jest-badges
```

### ðŸ”¶ Jest configuration

You will need to add json-summary to coverage reporters in jest config:

```javascript
module.exports = {
   coverageReporters: ["json-summary"];
};
```

## âš¡ Usage

You have two ways to generate coverage badges: cli and node. Both will create a 'badges' folder at project root where .svg files will be written.

### ðŸ”¶ Cli

You can add a script to your package.json like so:

```shell
  "scripts": {
    "badges": "generateBadges"
  },
```

### ðŸ”¶ Node

Another way is to directly use the package:

```javascript
import { generateBadges } from 'node-jest-badges';

(async () => {
  await generateBadges();
})();
```

## âš¡ Thanks

Big thanks to [Shield](https://github.com/badges/shields) for this awesome tool!
